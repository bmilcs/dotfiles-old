*cursorline_current.txt*	For Vim version 7.0	Last change: 2018 Aug 4

DESCRIPTION				*cursorline_current*

This plugin tweaks the behaviour of the 'cursorline' option to enable it only
in the current window, when not in insert mode, and (if supported) when Vim
has focus. It essentially makes 'cursorline' follow the cursor in normal mode
as much as possible.

It uses the global value of 'cursorline' as its default, and should also
correctly handle local values for windows.

REQUIREMENTS				*cursorline_current-requirements*

This plugin only loads if 'compatible' is not set. It requires the |+autocmd|
and |+windows| features.

OPTIONS 				*cursorline_current-options*

					*g:cursorline_current_insert*
Set `g:cursorline_current_insert` to 0 in your |vimrc| if you don't like the
cursor line switching off while you're in insert mode. This option defaults to
1.
