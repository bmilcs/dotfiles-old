## bmilcs/dotfiles

Welcome to version 2 of my dotfiles. Established in December of 2020 with 2 years of [light Debian experience](https://github.com/bmilcs/linux) under my belt, this GitHub repository became the official home of my personal configuration files. Windows is a requirement in my line of work, but I took the plunge and installed ArchLinux as my primary operating system within a dual-boot configuration.
