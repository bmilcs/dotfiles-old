### DRAINAGE QUOTE
> Our front lawn is graded incorrectly, our concrete 'patio' was installed too high, and danerously close to the sill plate in our framing. To top it off, the asphalt driveway leading to our garage aggressively persuades water to enter the home during heavy rain. At the bare minimum, I need a channel drain installed across the garage door and at worst, excavation of the entire concrete patio.  I would love to receive some professional insight & quotes at your earliest convenience --- preferably after 2:30pm on any weekday.
> My phone receives poor service, so e-mail is probably the best way to contact me if possible. I look forward to hearing back from you.
